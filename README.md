# SolarWinds-Evennia

This is a fresh attempt at my SolarWinds MUD concept, this time with the
Evennia engine: https://github.com/evennia/evennia/.

This is the base Evennia setup, with my modifications. There's a lot of code
and doc in the repo that came with Evennia. Some of the changes of note  that
I've made are listed below:

*typeclasses/channels.py* - _format_message()_
